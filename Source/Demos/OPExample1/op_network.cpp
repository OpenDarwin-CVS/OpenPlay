/* NOTES:

	- This example is designed so that all networking code is in this one file. The purpose is to make
		it easier for a programmer to study the basic use of OpenPlay's Protocol API and not to
		demonstrate good programming style or OOP practices.

	- This file is not game independent (hey, that's what OpenPlay is about!), it simply helped us keep
		the example use of OpenPlay's more managable ... we hope :)

	- This version of the network code utilizes OpenPlay's protocol api (low level functions prefixed with "Protocol")
	  It takes a bit more machinery to implement this way as opposed to the NetSprocket API; namely the ability to receive
	  network messages asynchronously. Note that this version of the app is not compatable with the NetSprocket version,
	  as NetSprocket adds message headers when sending data and whatnot.

	- This app uses datagrams exclusively. This is for simplicity, as a datagram is always received as a chunk the same size as it
	  was sent. The downside is that it is not guaranteed to arrive at the other end. This app assumes it does, and might malfunction
	  if any packets arrive out of order or are dropped. If we wanted to be more robust, we would implement a scheme to re-send
	  data if necessary. If we had used stream transfers (ProtocolSend instead of ProtocolSendPacket) we'd be sure
	  that everything would arrive in order, but we'd have to break the incoming data into packets manually, as it is not guaranteed
	  to arrive in chunks of any certain size.
